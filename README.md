  - The assigned problem statement (already allotted)
  - A quick start guide with examples to run your code
  - Any other details if we need to know
  
- Ensure **all code, documentation, and related work is committed to your forked repository**. 
- Make **regular commits** throughout the program. Your commit history will be considered during the evaluation to assess collaboration and progress.

All project-related discussions, updates, and queries must be conducted within this issue thread to ensure transparency and open collaboration across teams.

## Final Submission Guidelines

Please carefully follow the instructions below to ensure successful completion and evaluation of your project:

1. **Working Demo**  
   - Before the final submission, you must include a working demo of your project.  
   - The demo should clearly explain the problem statement and how your solution addresses it.  
   - Upload your project to a shared location (e.g., Google Drive) and include the access link.

2. **Presentation Requirement**  
   - You are required to prepare a brief presentation detailing your solution.  
   - This presentation must be delivered **offline** to the evaluation panel.  
   - The presentation will be scheduled towards the end of July.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**  
   - Your final evaluation and the issuance of a certificate of completion will be based on:
     - Submission of a working demo with a clear explanation.
     - A shared drive link to your project.
     - A completed offline presentation to the panel.
   - Any changes or deviations from these requirements must be discussed and approved by the program staff.
